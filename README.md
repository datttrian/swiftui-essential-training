## SwiftUI Essential Training
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course SwiftUI Essential Training. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

SwiftUI is becoming the primary user interface development framework for all Apple development. This UI tool kit provides layout structures, controls, and views that allow you to build user interfaces for the Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV—all from the same code. If you're curious how SwiftUI differs from UIKit and AppKit—or just want to get started with this powerful new tool kit—then this course is for you. Learn how you can make eye-catching user interfaces in just a few lines of code with instructor Steven Lipton. Steven teaches layout techniques for rapid development with buttons, pickers, images, and more. He demonstrates how to work with collection views, add navigation, and animate interactions. To lend these concepts a real-world context, he shows you how to build a reactive user interface for a pizza restaurant ordering app, building the app as you progress through the course.
